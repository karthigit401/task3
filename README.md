Task-03: Decision Tree Classifier – Bank Marketing Dataset
This project builds a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

📊 Objective
To train and evaluate a decision tree model that can predict customer purchase behavior from features like age, job, marital status, education, and previous marketing interactions.
